	<h3>
		Description
	</h3>
	<p>
		Unpromoted is an <span class="tag">app</span> and a <span class="tag">Safari extension</span> for <span class="tag">macOS</span>.
	</p>
	<p>
		With Unpromoted you can make your job search on <span class="tag">LinkedIn</span> significantly more <span class="tag">efficient</span>, <span class="tag">faster</span>, and arguable <span class="tag">easier</span>.
	</p>
	<p>
		This is achieved by adding filters to remove <i>Promoted</i> job ads from your search on <b>LinkedIn</b>, as most of the time these ads are totally unrelated to what you are looking for.
	</p>
	<p>
		It also allows you to filter-out <b>specific companies</b> that you do not wish to see anymore, as some job ads just keep popping-up, and there is no real way to hide them.
	</p>
	<p>
		We believe these features should be built-in on <b>LinkedIn</b> itself, and experience has taught us <i>Promoted</i> job ads are just a hindrance while searching for a job; something we could honestly do without when job hunting.
	</p>
	<p>
		...but in the meantime, you can have those features with <span class="tag">Unpromoted</span>.
	</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
