	<p>
		An app for browsing the web, built from the ground up to improve performance, security, privacy, and to make sure it fits the platform and and feels at home in your device.
	</p>
	<p>
		Performance/
		It is hard to put this in words, instead, try it for yourself, download Web Browser and see how fast it can load your favourite websites; did you notice the memory foot print of this app?
		Forget about using all your iPhone's storage downloading any other browser, this apps is under 10 MB and it plans to stay that way.
	</p>
	<p>
		Security/
		Allowing only secure connections with SSL and HTTPS and making sure websites you visit have valid certificates.
	</p>
	<p>
		Privacy/
		Anti-tracker protection and blocker, cookies blocker, and other features that make sure no one is watching your online activity, no one is finger printing you, and no one has access to your internet history.
	</p>
	<p>
		Ad-blocker/
		You won't see ads anymore.
	</p>
	<p>
		Tailored for platform fit/
		iOS//
		Making sure the design follows intuitive patterns, making it easy and reachable for your finger tips, and restricting the amount of touches that you need to accomplish any single task.
	</p>
	<p>
		Did you notice the search bar is at the bottom?
		Doesn't it feel more natural to have it accessible, closer to your thumb?
		Other web browsers, for example Safari, have also implemented the search bar at the bottom, but Web Browser was the first one to launch this revolutionary design, since back in 2020.
	</p>
	<p>
		macOS//
		Being on desktop means more power, more space, bigger screens, and bigger responsibilities. That is why it feels even more powerful than the competition, benchmark Web Browser against any other of your browsers, and you will notice a huge difference.
