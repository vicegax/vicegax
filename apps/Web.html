	<p>
		A Web Browser with an <b>Intelligence System</b> specifically designed for <b>Privacy</b> and <b>Security</b>.
	</p>
	
	<h3>
		Description
	</h3>
	
	<p>
		<span class="tag">Web</span> was created to give you an alternative way of <b>browsing</b> and exploring the <b>internet</b>; all other web browsers out there compromise in privacy and security in order to function on most websites, even browser apps that claim to be privacy oriented or to offer incognito browsing, by allowing websites to inject <b>Cookies</b>, have the door open for third-parties to track and finger-print you.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		This app is designed to work the other way around, Web rejects <b>all</b> Cookies by default, <b>preventing</b> any website from tracking you, finger-print your activity, or to share or store your personal information with others.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		Together with an State of the Art Intelligence System for <b>Anti Tracker Protection</b>, Web is the most secure Browser available.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		Because <b>Trackers</b> are blocked, and <b>Cookies</b> are prevented, Web is also the fastest Browser App available for iPhone, iPad (iOS) and Mac (macOS); have you ever wondered why some websites take forever to load? is all those unwanted third-party trackers consuming and monopolising up your bandwidth and data.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		Of course, this doesn't come easy, by preventing any tracking and disallowing any of your personal information from being stored in websites, Web is not compatible with some social networks, and it is also no recommended for online-purchases, as websites that require you to create accounts, or to make online payments, rely entirely on Cookies to function properly. For those specific cases we recommend that you revert back to your preferred <i>standard</i> web browser (Safari for example); for all other cases, Web is your best bet.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		Among the multiple features, we recommend that you try out <b>Web Intelligence</b>, and <b>Cookie Centre</b>. The former one gives you information and intelligence on your internet activity, including Trackers prevented, Cookies blocked, and Pop-ups stopped, the latter provides you a control centre to decide what Cookies to allow from websites that you trust.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		Make <span class="tag">Web</span> your <span class="tag">Default Browser</span> app.
